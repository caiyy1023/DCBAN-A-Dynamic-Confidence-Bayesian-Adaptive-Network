DCBAN: A Dynamic Confidence Bayesian Adaptive Network for Reconstructing Visual Images from fMRI Signals

Current fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging)-driven brain information decoding for visual image reconstruction techniques faces issues such as poor structural fidelity, inadequate model generalization, and unnatural visual image reconstruction in complex scenarios. To address these challenges, this study proposes a Dynamic Confidence Bayesian Adaptive Network (DCBAN). In this network model, deep nested Singular Value Decomposition is introduced to embed low-rank constraints into the deep learning model layers for fine-grained feature extraction, thus improving structural fidelity. The proposed Bayesian Adaptive Fractional Ridge Regression module, based on singular value space, dynamically adjusts the regularization parameters, significantly enhancing the decoder's generalization ability under complex stimulus conditions. The constructed Dynamic Confidence Adaptive Diffusion Model module incorporates a confidence network and time decay strategy, dynamically adjusting the semantic injection strength during the generation phase, further enhancing the details and naturalness of the generated images. The proposed DCBAN method is applied to the NSD dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 8.41%, 0.6%, and 4.8% in PixCorr (0.361), Incep (96.0%), and CLIP (97.8%), respectively, achieving the current best performance in both structural and semantic fMRI visual image reconstruction.
